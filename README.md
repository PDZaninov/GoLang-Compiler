This is a student project done for Oracle for CMPS 116/117 at UCSC.

Oracle’s Multilingual Engine (MLE) allows multiple languages to freely interoperate. This enables users to work with a language of their choosing when working with Oracle’s database products. The MLE relies upon the Truffle framework and Truffle languages to execute source code within the database process space. The goal of this project was to incorporate a subset of Go into Truffle’s suite of languages.

Documentation on the subset completed can be found here: https://pdzaninov.github.io/GoLang-Compiler/
