This is a student project done for Oracle for CMPS 116/117 at UCSC.

Oracle’s Graal Compiler and Truffle technologies allows multiple languages to freely interoperate. The goal of this project was to incorporate a subset of Go into Truffle’s suite of languages.

Documentation on the subset completed can be found here: https://pdzaninov.github.io/GoLang-Compiler/
